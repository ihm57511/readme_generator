  ## Installation  
  Installation instructions for this project require the user to clone the repo from GitHub. The dependency for this application, inquirer, will then need installation before running the app. Simply navigate to the Develop folder in your terminal and run the command `npm i --y`. After inquirer has loaded, the application is ready to run.
  ## Usage  
  After installation, the user may use a terminal window to navigate to the stored location of the 'utils' folder. Once there, the app may be run by using the command 'node index.js'. From here, the automatic prompts should be self-explanatory.
